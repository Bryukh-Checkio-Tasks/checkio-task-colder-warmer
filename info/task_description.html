    Let's play a search game. Given a map 10x10 cell. In some cell hidden your goal.
    You can move at any cell in the field.
    At each move you got information about closer or farther from goal you at comparison from previous location.
    Your function got data about previous steps at each step as a list of list, where first and second elements are
    coordinate (row and column) and third is info about alteration -- "colder" is -1, "warmer" is 1 and "same" is 0.
    For measurement the distance to the goal we use Euclidean distance. At each step you should return the coordinates for new step.
    If you placed at the goal cell, then you win. You should find the goal at <strong>10</strong> steps.

    <strong>Input: </strong> Information about previous steps. A list of list. Each list contains coordinates and alteration.

    <strong>Output: </strong> Coordinates of new move. A list of two integers.
